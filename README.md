# Find Distance for Blender 2.9

> This add-on _should_ be compatible with 2.8+, but has only been tested on 2.9; additionally, this add-on is still a work in progress and may be missing some features and prone to bugs.

This is a simple add-on designed to help find the location and rotation offset between two transforms within a Blender project. Upon executing any of the operators provided by this add-on, it will calculate the desired offsets and copy them to the clipboard. You can then do with this information what you will.

**A bit of backstory...** I built this add-on to help me determine the difference between empties and bones so that I could more accurately place sockets in Unreal Engine.
